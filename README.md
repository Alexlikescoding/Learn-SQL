CREATE TABLE creates a new table

INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table

SELECT queries data from a table

ALTER TABLE changes an existing table

UPDATE edits a row in a table

The WHERE clause filters rows, whereas the HAVING clause filter groups
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because WHERE could not be used with aggregate functions
